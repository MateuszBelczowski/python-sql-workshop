(now)\n\nIt was my decision to get clean, I did it for me.\nAdmittedly, I probably did it subliminally\nFor you, so I could come back a brand new me you helped see me through.\nAnd don't even realize what you did, believe me you.\nI been through the ringer, but they could do little to the middle finger.\nI think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of\nmy world, haters can make like bees with no stingers\nand drop dead, no more beef lingers.\nNo more drama from now on, wanna promise\nto focus solely on handling my responsibilities as a father.\nSo I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters\nand raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it!\nCause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club,\nor the corner pub, and lift the whole liquor counter up.\nCause I'm raising the bar,\nI'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazing in stars.\nI feel amazing and I'm...\n\n[Chorus:]\nI'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)\nTo take a stand (to take a stand)\nEverybody (everybody)\nCome take my hand.

Why is Mommy crying?\"\nBaby, Daddy ain't leaving no more, \"Daddy you're lying\n\"You always say that, you always say this is the last time\n\"But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy you're mine\"\nShe's piling boxes in front of the door trying to block it\n\"Daddy please, Daddy don't leave, Daddy - no stop it!\"\nGoes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket\nIt's got a picture, \"this'll keep you safe Daddy, take it withcha'\"\nI look up, it's just me standing in the mirror\nThese fuckin' walls must be talking, cuz man I can hear 'em\nThey're saying \"You've got one more chance to do right\" - and it's tonight\nNow go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late\nAnd just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door\nIt turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on\nAnd I'm singing...\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn\nRejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice\nJust know that I'm looking down on you smiling\nAnd I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain\nJust smile back\nAnd when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn\nRejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice\nJust know that I'm looking down on you smiling\nAnd I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain\nJust smile back...\n\n[Verse 3]\nSixty thousand people, all jumping out their seat\nThe curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet\nI take a bow and thank you all for coming out\nThey're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd\nI glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing\n\"Daddy it's me, help Mommy, her wrists are bleeding,\"\nBut baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?\n\"I followed you Daddy, you told me that you ain't leavin'\n\"You lied to me Dad, and now you make Mommy sad\n\"And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'\n\"That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin\n\"I get the point - fine, me and Mommy are going\"\nBut baby wait, \"it's too late Dad, you made the choice\n\"Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us\"\nThat's what they want, they want you Marshall, they keep.. screamin' your name\nIt's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill\nYeah, I bet you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real\nI hear applause, all this time I couldn't see\nHow could it be, that the curtain is closing on me\nI turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it\nPut it to my brain and scream \"die Shady\" and pop it\nThe sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes\nThat's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'\nIt's Spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk right up to Kim and kiss her\nTell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister\nAlmost as if to say..\n\n[Chorus/Outro]\n\nAnd when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn\nRejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice\nJust know that I'm looking down on you smiling\nAnd I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain\nJust smile back\nAnd when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn\nRejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice\nJust know that I'm looking down on you smiling\nAnd I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain\nJust smile back...\n\n[Curtains closing and sounds of clapping]"

    "lyrics": "I was in the winter of my life. And the men I met along the road were my only summer. At night I fell sleep with visions of myself dancing and laughing and crying with them. Three years down the line of being on an endless world tour and my memories of them were the only things that sustained me and my only real happy times.\n\nI was a singer, not a very popular one. I once had dreams of becoming a beautiful poet. But upon an unfortunate series of events saw those dreams dashed and divided like million stars in the night sky. That I wished on over and over again sparkling and broken. But I really didn\u2019t mind because I knew that it takes getting everything you ever wanted and then losing it to know what true freedom is.\n\nWhen the people I used to know found out what I had been doing, how I had been living, they asked me why but there\u2019s no use in talking to people who have a home. They have no idea what it\u2019s like to seek safety in other people for home to be wherever you lie you head.\n\nI was always an unusual girl. My mother told me that I had a chameleon soul, no moral compass pointing me due north, no fixed personality, just an inner indecisiveness that was as wide and wavering as the ocean. And if I said I didn\u2019t plan for it to turn out this way, I\u2019d be lying.\n\nBecause I was born to be the other woman who belonged to no one, who belonged to everyone, who had nothing, who wanted everything, with a fire for every experience and an obsession for freedom that terrified me to the point that I couldn\u2019t even talk about it and pushed me to a nomadic point of madness that both dazzled and dizzied me.\n\nI've been out on that open road\nYou can be my full time daddy, white and gold\nSinging blues has been getting old\nYou can be my full time baby, hot or cold\n\nDon't break me down\nI've been traveling too long\nI've been trying too hard\nWith one pretty song\n\nI hear the birds on the summer breeze\nI drive fast, I am alone at midnight\nBeen trying hard not to get into trouble\nBut I, I've got a war in my mind\nSo I just ride, just ride, I just ride, I just ride\n\nDying young and playing hard\nThat's the way my father made his life an art\nDrink all day and we talk till dark\nThat\u2019s the way the road dogs do it, light till dark\n\nDon't leave me now\nDon't say goodbye\nDon't turn around\nLeave me high and dry\n\nI hear the birds on the summer breeze\nI drive fast, I am alone at midnight\nBeen trying hard not to get in trouble\nBut I, I've got a war in my mind\nI just ride, just ride, I just ride, I just ride\n\nI'm tired of feeling like I'm fucking crazy\nI'm tired of driving till I see stars in my eyes\nIt's all I've got to keep myself sane, baby\nSo I just ride, I just ride\n\nI hear the birds on the summer breeze\nI drive fast, I am alone at midnight\nBeen trying hard not to get in trouble\nBut I, I've got a war in my mind\nI just ride, just ride, I just ride, I just ride\n\nEvery night I used to pray that I\u2019d find my people and finally I did on the open road. We had nothing to lose, nothing to gain, nothing we desired anymore except to make our lives into a work of art. Live fast. Die young. Be wild. And have fun.\n\nI believe in the country America used to be. I believe in the person I want to become. I believe in the freedom of the open road. And my motto is the same as ever. I believe in the kindness of strangers. And when I'm at war with myself, I ride. I just ride.\n\nWho are you? Are you in touch with all of your darkest fantasies? Have you created a life for yourself where you can experience them? I have. I am fucking crazy. But I am free."

Keep it between friends?\nThough I know you'll never love me, like you used to\n\nThere maybe other people like us,\nWho see the flicker of the clipper when they light up,\nFlames just create us, burns don't heal like before\nYou don't hold me anymore\n\nOn cold days cold play's out like the band's name\nI know I cant heal things with a handshake\nYou know I can change, as I began saying\nYou cut me wide open like landscape\nOpen bottles of beer but never champagne\nTo applaud you with the sound that my hands make\n\nShould I? Should I?\nMaybe I'll get drunk, again\nI'll be drunk, again\nI'll be drunk, again\nTo feel a little love\n\nAll by myself\nI'm here again\nAll by myself\nYou know I'll never change\nAll by myself\nAll by myself\n\nI'm just drunk, again\nI'll be drunk, again\nI'll be drunk, again\nTo feel a little love"

I was confused about\nShe should figure it out while I'm sat here singing\nAh-la-la-la-la-la\n\nDon't fuck with my love\nThat heart is so cold\nAll over my home \nI don't wanna know that babe\n\nAh-la-la-la-la-la\n\nDon't fuck with my love\nI told her she knows\nTake aim and reload\nI don't wanna know that babe\nAh-la-la-la-la-la\n\n[Knock knock knock] \non my hotel door\nI don't even know if she knows what for\nShe was crying on my shoulder\nI already told ya\nTrust and respect is what we do this for\nI never intended to be next\nBut you didn't need to take him to bed that's all\nAnd I never saw him as a threat\nUntil you disappeared with him to have sex of course\nIt's not like we were both on tour\nWe were staying on the same fucking hotel floor\nAnd I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment\nBut it was never just fun and I thought you were different\nThis is not the way you realise what you wanted\nIt's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest\nAnd all this time God knows I'm singing\nAh-la-la-la-la-la\n\n\nDon't fuck with my love\nThat heart is so cold\nAll over my home \nI don't wanna know that babe\n\nAh-la-la-la-la-la\n\nDon't fuck with my love\nI told her she knows\nTake aim and reload\nI don't wanna know that babe\n\nAh-la-la-la-la-la"

Can you feel it?\n\nSummer evening breezes blew\nDrawing voices deep from you\nLed by your beating heart\n\nWhat a year and what a night\nWhat terrifying final sights\nPut out your beating heart\n\nThe night was all you had\nYou ran into the night from all you had\nFound yourself a path upon the ground\nYou ran into the night you can't be found\n\n[Chorus]\nBut this is your heart\nCan you feel it? Can you feel it?\nPumps through your veins\nCan you feel it? Can you feel it?\n\nIf you had your gun would you shoot it at the sky? \nWhy? To see where it would fall\nOh, will you come down at all?\nIf you had your gun would you shoot it at the sky?\nWhy? To see where your bullet would fall\nOh, will you come down at all?\n\n[Chorus]\nThis is your heart\nCan you feel it? Can you feel it?\nPumps through your veins\nCan you feel it?

    "lyrics": "Let me tell you a story to chill the bones about a things that I saw \n\r\nOne night wandering in the everglades. I'd one drink but no more \n\r\n\r\nI was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight. Gazing up at the stars \n\r\nNot aware of a presence so near to me. Watching my every move \n\r\n\r\nFeeling scared and I fell to my knees. As something rushed me from the trees \n\r\nTook me to an unholy place. And that is where I fell from grace \n\r\n\r\nThen they summoned me over to join in with them. To the dance of the dead \n\r\nIn to the circle of fire I followed them. In to the middle I was led \n\r\n\r\nAs if time had stopped still I was numb with fear. But still I wanted to go \n\r\nAnd the blaze of the fire did not hurt upon me. As I walked onto the coals \n\r\n\r\nAnd I felt I was in a trance. And my spirit was lifted from me \n\r\nAnd if only someone had the chance. To witness what happened to me \n\r\n\r\nAnd I danced and I pranced and I sang with them. All had death in their eyes \n\r\nLifeless figures they were undead all of them. They had ascended from hell \n\r\n\r\nAs I danced with the dead my free spirit was laughing and howling down at me \n\r\nBelow my undead body just danced the circle of dead \n\r\n\r\nUntil the time came to reunite us both. My spirit came back down to me \n\r\nI didn't know if I was alive or dead. As the others all joined in with me \n\r\n\r\nBy luck then a skirmish started. And took the attention away from me \n\r\nWhen they took their gaze from me. Was the moment that I fled \n\r\n\r\nI ran like hell faster than the wind. But behind I did not glance \n\r\nOne thing that I did not dare. Was to look just straight ahead \n\r\n\r\nWhen you know that your time has come around. You know you'll be prepared for it. \n\r\nSay your last goodbyes to everyone. Drink and say a prayer for it \n\r\n\r\nWhen you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed \n\r\nAnd you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead \n\r\nWhen you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed \n\r\nAnd you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead \n\r\n\r\nTo this day I guess I'll never know. Just why they let me go \n\r\nBut I'll never go dancing no more. 'Til I dance with the dead"
